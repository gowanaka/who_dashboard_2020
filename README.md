# WHO Interactive Dashboard: Explore the Disease Death Probability Dataset

### Go directly to the dashboard: -> [Dashboard Link](https://reminho.shinyapps.io/who_2020_shinydashboard/) <-

To explore the WHO Dataset on cumulative death probabilities of CDCC diseases (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases) 
across different countries and split up by gender, I built an interactive dashboard including inputs, infoboxes, 
plots and a chloropleth map using the packages *shiny*, *shinydashboard*, and *leaflet* in R. This is the first version of the dashboard.
A comprehensive notebook describing the dashboard can be found on my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/reminho/who-dashboard-eda).

# 1. Short description: What does it do?

So far the dashboard is divided into four tabs: **summary**, **inputs**, **plots** and **maps**.

* **Summary** summarizes the main findings of the data exploration with infoboxes, plots, and a map on one page.
    + All infoboxes except the one in the top right corner are responsive to the year input.
    + The left plot shows the CDCC death probability for a given country over time (from 2000 to 2016) and split up by sex. 
    Users can select the country they want to look at in the input from the sidebar.
        + Update (06/01/2021): It is now possible to compare two countries in the same plot by clicking "Compare to another country"!
    * The map on the right shows the whole world with the countries depicted as interactive polygons. 
    Each polygon is colored by the country's CDCC death probability in a given year. Red signals higher and green signals lower probability. 
    Users can select the year.
* **Inputs** shows an interactive datatable of the dataset used to build the plots and map(s).
* **Plots** is populated with plots.
    + Update (10/01/2021): Added "compare to another country" function to the second plot. It will now show a comparison of two countries should the user select that.
    + Update (09/01/2020): Added the summary plot again. Added a second plot showing the percent difference in death probability of a given period compared to the previous period. The dashed line represents no change (0%). Everything below is a reduction, Everything above is an increase. The year 2000 is not shown, because it is the earliest period in the dataset.
* **Maps** will include a bigger map.

# 2. File descriptions

* **who_2020_data/** folder contains all the filtered and raw data used by the dashboard.
* **who_cdcc_map.r** contains the code used for the map that is included on the "summary" tab.
* **who_dashboard.r** is the main script thats run to create the app. It contains the code used to build the header, sidebar and body of the dashboard. All inputs and outputs are included. It sources some objects from *who_objects.r*.
* **who_filtered_data.r** shows how I filtered the data found in the *who_2020_data/* folder.
* **who_objects.r** contains some R objects that are sourced by the main app script.
* **who_test_plots.r** contains explanations on how I built the plots in the app.
